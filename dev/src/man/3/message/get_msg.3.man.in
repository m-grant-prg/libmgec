NAME
get_msg - Get a message from the buffer.
SYNOPSIS
#include <mgemessage.h>

struct mgemessage *get_msg(struct mgebuffer *buf,
		struct mgemessage *msg);

DESCRIPTION
If a complete message exists in the buffer, get_msg() populates the mgemessage
struct message field and sets the complete field. The mgemessage struct is not
fully populated on exit, use deconstruct_msg() for that. The buffer offset is
updated but the message is not actually removed from the buffer, use trim_buf()
for that.

mge_errno is set as required.
PARAMETERS
buf - a pointer to the mgebuffer struct buffer to use as the source.
.br
msg - a pointer to the mgemessage struct to populate.

RETURN VALUE
Return value is a pointer to the not fully populated mgemessage struct or NULL
on error.

ERRORS
mge_errno is set as required.
