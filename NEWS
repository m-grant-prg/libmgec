macros).
Correct the expected answers in the bstree test suite.
Rename mgebuffer.offset member to proc_next.
Rename mgebuffer.index member to next_free.
If the buffer in the mgebuffer struct passed to concat_buf is NULL,
allocate the default buffer size.
Correct the types of some local variables.
Change mgebuffer index fields to type size_t.
Rename mgemessage.offset member to next_free.
Change mgemessage.complete member type to bool.
Assign value to mgebuffer.size on allocation, not before.
get_msg() - realloc using buffer size macro for readability.
Add build support for using gcc -H for header file checks.

Release 1.1.7 2018-06-19
Add informational messages to make srctarball output.
get_msg now accommodates partial messages without re-processing the entire
buffer. Data from the buffer extracted to the message struct could be a complete
message, (terminated with the mgemessage.terminator), or a partial message. If
it is an incomplete message then data will be appended to the partial message
next time this function is invoked, repeating until a complete message is held
in the struct.
In deconstruct_msg replace hardcoded token string ",;" with message struct
separator and terminator fields.
In deconstruct_msg() add check that the message is complete.
Disable sparse Variable Length Array warnings.
Improve README file.

Add counter and node totals to the bstree struct.

Release 1.1.5 2018-04-16
Ensure required directories exist, even if empty.

Release 1.1.4 2018-04-16
Start git tracking of m4 and src/prg/c/gen/lib as downstream packaging using a
source (AOT distribution) tarball requires these gnulib elements to be present.
Add information on utility scripts to the README file.

Release 1.1.3 2018-04-15
Update this project bootstrap.sh to latest version 1.3.4.
Improve README file.
Add a make target srctarball to make a source tarball. This can be used in the
same way as github's source tarball enabling 1 package methodolgy irrespective
of source repository.

Release 1.1.2 2018-02-27
Add Doxygen comments.
Overhaul of AutoTools project structure.

Release 1.1.0 2017-05-03
Return NULL pointer, -1 or error number when possible on error.
Apply coding standards from template atclstv v1.0.0
Add buffer, message and memory functions.
Introduce library-wide mge_errno variable and error handling.
Add bst trace function to provide node coordinates.
Add exhaustive bstree tests.
Introduce concept and support for a discreet bst object.

Release 1.0.7 2016-05-06
Add double linked list functionality.

Release 1.0.6 2016-05-05
Add single linked list functionality.

Release 1.0.5 2015-11-04
Change from bt and btree names to bst and bstree as this is a binary search tree,
not a b-tree.

Release 1.0.4 2015-10-25
Restructure and change to conform to AutoTools General Template v1.0.6.

Release 1.0.3 2015-09-18
All changes are to btree.
Change function names to XXX_bt_node().
Change find_bt_node() to get_counter_bt_node() as it returns the count.
Add find_bt_node(), upd_bt_node().
Change free_btree() to return NULL.
Add unique flag to add_bt_node().
Improve overall use of btree_errno.
Modify del_bt_node() to decrement the node counter instead of deleting the
node if the counter is > 1, (i.e. duplicates are allowed).
Add function parameter checking.
Change defined flags and errors to be easily identifiable as btree elements.
Complies with MG AutoTools General standard version 1.0.4.

Release 1.0.2 2015-08-11
Add btree functions delnode() and static freenode().

Release 1.0.1 2015-08-07
